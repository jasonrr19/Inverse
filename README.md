### Project Goal
To create narrative tension through gameplay logic and environment design without relying on cutscenes. I focused on "blocking" the level to create sightlines and using AI state machines to pace the encounter.

### Technical Implementation
* **AI Logic:** Implemented State Machines (Patrol -> Alert -> Combat) using a hybrid of C++ base classes and Blueprint graphs.
* **Pacing:** Used trigger volumes to control enemy spawn timing to ensure the player is never overwhelmed but constantly pressured.
* **Debugging:** Created visual debug tools to track AI perception states in real-time.
